# 7D2D_ModExtender
Extends maximum available mods for items and armors from 4 to 6, 1 for each item level.

Should work for future releases. Made it since I could not find a simple mod just for this.

It’s a patch, so it should be compatible with most mods that do not modify mod count.

I did not know how to increase UI size for more mods to be visible
(if files get modified to increase beyond 6, you can put mods with shift+click, but you can’t see them or take them back from the item).
